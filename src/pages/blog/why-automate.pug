            h1 How to thrive in an automated society
            p.intro-paragraph How do you thrive when you're constantly being disrupted by leaner, faster, more automated competition on a global scale?

            p Specialist software we wrote on a bespoke basis 5 years ago is now available to anyone with Â£30/month to spare, and jobs that were specialist roles 10 years ago now no longer exist. Cars are becoming self driving, you can speak to your computer like it's a person, and startups are regularly disrupting and toppling entire industries.

            p All of this change is being driven smart people leveraging software automation. There's been a lot of gloomy talk in the media about the impact this is having on jobs and businesses, and while a fully automated society is a way off still, automation presents significant challenges for businesses not wise to it, and significant opportunities for those with an eye on the horizon.

            p None of us can afford to keep our head in the sand, so in this post, we'll answer the following questions:

            ul
              li What is automation?
              li Why is automation a big deal?
              li How will automation affect businesses?
              li How can I adapt and thrive with automation?

            h3 What is automation?
            p Automation is a trend towards less human involvement being needed to complete business activities. In this post, we'll focus on the automation of information-based activities, acheived through software.

            p Some basic examples of automation include:

            ul
              li <strong>Allowing customers to interact with your business on a self-service basis:</strong> This is typically via a web portal or a smartphone app, but could be over a phone call, using a digital voice assistant ("Hey Google"), or even via a television-based app.
              li <strong>Supplementing or replacing customer service roles:</strong> Chatbots, support sites, ticketing systems, and community forums take the burdern of providing support away from staff.
              li <strong>Automating internal data processing:</strong> Where reports were manually collated, they can now be generated automatically. Where data was stored across multiple systems (or filing cabinets), is can now be digital, centralised, and searchable. Where data previously needed to be processed by a person, we can now make decisions and derive insight using software systems, and Artificial Intelligence.
              li <strong>Integrations with other organisations and systems:</strong> Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Software Development Kits (SDKs) allow the systems in one business to interact with other businesses, making vast amounts of data and cutting edge technology accessible to even the smallest organisations.

            p Automation is largely driven by technological and cultural changes:

            ul
              li <strong>Improvements in infrastructure:</strong> Faster, more reliable networks mean businesses can count on technology working seamlessly for their customers.
              li <strong>Software proliferation:</strong> Where organisations used to have to build all of their own software, there are now many website, CRM, advertising, reporting and support products that can be integrated and managed  with little technical knowledge.
              li <strong>Globalisation:</strong> Instead of operating at a local or national level, it's common for many new businesses operate globally right away. Globalised business requires high levels of automation by default.
              li <strong>Changing expectations:</strong> As consumers benefit from the convenience automation can bring, their expectations rise, while their tolerance for hassle, delays, and expending effort lowers.
              li <strong>Other automation:</strong> Because automated activities can handle high volume, un-automated activities in processes quickly become bottlenecks. These then require automation in turn to keep throughput high throughout the entire process.

            h3 Why is automation a big deal?

            p Well implemented automation increases the speed, accuracy, scaleability, competitiveness, and global reach of a business, while also reducing its costs. These increases are typically orders of magnitude larger than their non-automated counterparts.

            p Where a person-based sales team might be able to process 200 customers per day, a well automated sales funnel could cope with 200,000 for a similar cost, and could be scaled to 2 million or beyond. What's more, the automated funnel will provide a better service, being easily accessible to customers any time, anywhere, on any device, and in many languages.

            p E-commerce isn't new, but it's a good illustration from recent history of the power of automation to level the playing field. We now live in a world where tiny companies are able to compete with much larger established players, and where customers are gained or lost based on the quality of the product offered, rather than the size of the company offering it.

            p When automation is combined with innovation, startups can even force change in an entire industry by providing a radically better solution to a problem; a process known as disruption.

            p It's easy to think of them as giants now, but Netflix, a 21 year old company, famously disrupted and destroyed the traditional movie rental industry. It then went on to disrupt broadcast television. Similarly, Amazon is barely 25 years old, but has changed the way we shop forever, and become one of the worlds most valuable companies in the process.

            p In more recent times, Uber has disrupted the taxi industry, Tesla has disrupted the automotive industry, and AirBnB has disrupted the travel industry.

            p Using automation to provide innovative products and services is a common trait among the worlds leading businesses, and it is being embraced in ever smaller markets to get a competitive edge. In order to stay competitive tomorrow, you must understand and embrace automation today.

            p EDITED UP TO HERE!!!

            h3 How will automation affect business?
            p Automation will gradually replace human activities, allowing them to be completed faster, to a higher quality, and more cost effectively. With this in mind, to understand how automation will affect society, you need to understand how easy or hard things are to automate:

            ul
              li <strong>Easy:</strong> Repetitive simple tasks involving structured high-quality data. Examples include e-commerce & online advertisting, structured information capture, data storage and retrieval, structured report generation.
              li <strong>Medium:</strong> Repetitive complex tasks involving varying qualities of information. Examples include tailored online experiences for different customer types, automatically cleaning up poorly structured or inaccurate data using services, deriving basic insights from analytics, detecting fraudulent patterns of behaviour, assigning of workloads to staff.
              li <strong>Hard:</strong> Complex tasks involving understanding of language and context. Examples include highly effective chatbot or automated phone support, highly accurate/useful extraction of structured data from written text or images, sentiment analysis, predicting behaviour patterns, deriving deep/complex insights from data.
              li <strong>Currently impossible:</strong> Tasks involving understanding of complex language, context, emotion or human activities. Examples include people management, empathy with disgruntled customers, generating effective marketing material, content creation, product design, software development, complex decision making with limited information.

            h4 Now
            p Activities from the "easy" and "medium" categories above are already beginning to become a thing of the past. Call centres are being replaced by online portals and apps, and information is already processed and reported on in an highly automated way in a lot of businesses. Software is faster, better and cheaper than people for these tasks.

            p Activities from the "hard" category can be partially automated with, but typically require some human supervision. Chat bots and automated phone support can help to solve a lot of support queries, but businesses that rely on them too much tend to frustrate customers a real person is needed to help them with a complex or unique situation. Here, automation is supporting staff to allow them to do achieve more, but not replacing roles entirely.

            p Activities from the "Currently impossible" category are too complex to automate with today's technologies. They typically require generalised understanding, empathy, intelligence, and management skills, and would require true generalised Artificial Intelligence (AI) to replace. Today's AIs are limited to specialised single purposes like driving cars or recognising faces. They can't be taught to do anything as complex as make a sandwich, let alone manage a team of people.

            h4 Future
            p Businesses will continue to adopt all cost-effective forms of automation, while seeking to leverage the scaling opportunities that come with them. All of this will lead to increases in speed, quality of service, and scale.

            p We can expect to see increasing numbers of small and medium sized businesses nailing the easy and medium categories above, while selectively adopting the harder automations as their effectiveness develops.

            p As AI improves to become more generalised and more productised, we'll see AI based tools begin to support activities in the "currently impossible" category, drastically improving the quality of management and decision making.

            p Niching will continue to rise in popularity as a way to carve out a competitive edge. This will be made popular business model, as building highly automated, scaleable businesses with fewer staff and at a lower cost continues to get easier. Niche businesses will typically take the form of "x for x", e.g. "A job board for remote workers", "Business insurance for freelancers", "A trading platform for sneaker enthusiasts".

            p Lastly, poorly automated businesses will have to embrace automation to survive. Getting smarter, faster, scaleable, and globalised will not be a choice, but a requirement to stay competitive and avoid disruption.

            h3 How can I adapt and thrive with automation?

            h4 Long term thinking

            p Make a commitment to drive automation forward over the long term. Like getting fit, this may require significant amount of work up front, but eventually you'll just be maintaining to stay at the cutting edge, rather than grinding to get there.

            h4 Take a smart approach
            p Many businesses automate individual activities without looking at their whole business operation as a system. This approach is prone to causing bottlenecks at other steps of the businesses operations where automation opportunities are difficult or poorly understood. To truly get the most from automation, you need to look at an entire process, and intelligently apply automation where it can have the greatest effect, repeatedly automating to remove bottlenecks and get the greatest benefit across the entire process. We wrote [an entire blog post on using process maps to achieve this](https://weareleaf.com/blog/automate-where-it-matters-with-process-maps)

            h4 Invest in your own software

            p Don't just rely on off the shelf automation software. Invest in your own automation technology where appropriate. Much off the shelf software is brilliant, but many businesses rely on staff to form the glue between the data housed in the separate systems. By investing in your own software to connect the data from these systems, you can fully auomate much of your businesses operation, and create unique, hard to replicate intellctual property in the process. A common example of this is integrating the data from your CRM, your web portal, with your analytics platforms together, and making it accessible via an API for other services in your organisation, like mobile apps, or new products, and even other businesses.

            h4 Embrace scale, and niching
            p Traditional logic tells us that in order to thrive, we need many customers and so we should cast a wide net and remain generalists in order to attract and win as much business as possible. Unfortunately, it's hard to grow a business that caters for everyone's needs to a global scale in an automated way, and as you try, you end up blending into the crowd of countless other businesses offering the exact same thing.

            p Picking a niche makes it easier to automate your processes as your customers increasingly fit a similar mold that you can build robust processes around. You can then scale this globally while standing out from the crowd as the clear choice for your particular niche.

            h4 Hunt for new revenue streams
            p As you automate, you'll free up time for your business to work on other things. You can compound yourÂ automation benefits by leveraging your existing automations to cater for new markets, or building new products entirely. Common examples include:

            ul
              li Charging other organisations to integrate with your services on a self-service basis, usually via an API or Software Development Kid (SDK).
              li Becoming established in a niche at a global level, and *then* beginning to generalise from a position of strength.
              li Selling customer information, in an ethical way.
              li Teaching, and consulting for other businesses.
              li Building entirely new products that complement your existing product offerings.

            p This not only allows you to grow your business, but helps to diversify your revenue to protect against uncertainty in the future.

            h4 Focus on the 80%

            p The Pareto Principle states that roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. While it's not a hard rule, it applies in an uncanny way to all kinds of situations. In automated businesses, for example, it's normal for 80% of the manual work to come from 20% (or less) of the customers.

            p With this in mind, it usually makes financial sense to focus your automation efforts on catering for the 80% of customers that fit neatly into a similar mold, rather than wasting a lot of time and effort going after the unpredictable 20% that need human intervention to process. You may even want to hone your marketing efforts at attracting these customers, and letting those which prevent you from automating go elsewhere.

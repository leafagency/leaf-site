          h4 About the role
          p We celebrate our 4<sup>th</sup> birthday in June, and while it has been a wonderful ride to be on, we're looking for a researcher to help ensure that the next 4 are every bit as fun.
          p To date, Leaf's marketing strategy could be boiled down to something along the lines of, #[em 'people talk; do good work, and we'll win more']. Going forward, that strategy will be somewhat more calculated, and research is that heart of it.

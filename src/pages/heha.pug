          h4.case-study__block-heading The challenge
          p.case-study__block-text As with any incubated startup, our commodity was time. We had a small window of opportunity to answer a number of questions; what was important to our users when planning a trip? What tools and processes did travellers currently use? Was there even a hunger for such an app?

          h4.case-study__block-heading Our approach
          p.case-study__block-text Speaking to thousands to customers a day, the Holiday Extras team had realised that there were recurring pain-points when planning trips away, and the initial vision was driven by a desire to tackle these stresses.
          p.case-study__block-text By using React Native, the team were able to most efficiently work towards both iOS and Android versions of the application. From a design perspective, mapping to the iOS Human Interface Guidelines and Material Design respectfully provided a toolkit to further speed up our decision making.

          h4.case-study__block-heading User testing
          p.case-study__block-text Early user testing sessions were invaluable in not only validating design decisions, but in gauging how closely the initial brief resonated with travellers.
          p.case-study__block-text While feedback was largely positive, we found that users didn't simply want an inspirational app, but something truly personalised to to them and their trip.

          h4.case-study__block-heading Post-MVP
          p.case-study__block-text Having taken stock of the user testing sessions, we began working towards addressing the recurring patterns, with a trip itinerary and shared documentation heavily requested.
          p.case-study__block-text Over the next few months, we began moving away from the native design frameworks we'd initially used, introducing more of our own personality into the applications.
          p.case-study__block-text In August 2017, we even had an opportunity to test our work for real, joining the HEHA! team for a 4-day break in Rome; for work purposes, of course.

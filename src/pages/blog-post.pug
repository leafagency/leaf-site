            h1 The power of small development phases
            p.intro-paragraph Imagine this scenario — someone in your company proposes a new software feature with the potential to save the business thousands of hours of human effort per year. It’s going to replace it all with error free, instant, cheap automation.
            p Planning of the feature begins, and strategic stakeholders add scope with “could it also…” questions in order to maximise benefit to the business. Then, as possible edge case issues are identified, operational stakeholders add scope with “what about…” questions so that every angle is covered.
            p Discussions drag on for weeks, and before you know it, the small feature has grown into a large project. At this point, getting agreement between everyone involved has become very difficult.
            p Eventually a compromise is reached and development on the feature begins. However, progress is slow as all the additional requirements and edge cases are worked through. Unanticipated blockers are frequent, and the non-technical stakeholders start to wonder what’s taking so long.

            h4 Heading
            p Over time confidence in the work drops, and eventually other urgent changes take priority. Work on the feature is paused, scaled back significantly, or sometimes even cancelled altogether. Stakeholders and developers are all left frustrated and disheartened by the experience.
            p Sound familiar? It doesn’t have to be this way. All of this pain can be avoided by just breaking your projects into small and separate <strong>phases</strong>.

            h4 Heading
            p Using simple numbers, if there’s a 20% potential improvement from some new feature, there’s nothing wrong with implementing that in eight 2.5% phases; each one agreed, worked on, and deployed separately. In fact, this approach has many benefits:

            //-p.quote Most of us bounce in and out of this cycle several times a year. This is leaving us less successful, less productive and less happy than we could otherwise be.
          
            p This cycle continues until either we decide to give ourselves a reprieve, the stressors disappear, or we’re forced to stop through burnout. The good news is, this isn’t how life has to be.

            h4 How you can change this
            p Organisations are unlikely to do much to rectify the situation as they’re often either unaware of the problem, or just aren’t incentivised to change. They see the output you generate, but it’s much harder for them to see the personal time invested, or personal toll work related stress can take on you.
            p The hard truth you need to face is that the solution to your work life balance is actually entirely in your control. All of the ability to control your situation rests with you, your employers and co-workers can only influence you, they cannot make you do anything. To begin improving the situation, all you have to do is stop:

            })

              bulletContent: "<ul class=\"styled-list styled-list--inside-sm\"><li class=\"styled-list__item\"><strong>Small phases build trust.</strong> Specifically, this occurs between developers and stakeholders. No more wondering whether anything will ever be finished.</li><li class=\"styled-list__item\"><strong>Small phases are easy to renegotiate.</strong> If alterations need to be made, small changes can be renegotiated without needing to re-check agreement on everything else.</li><li class=\"styled-list__item\"><strong>Small phases are simple to estimate.</strong> Smaller changes to a system are easier to estimate accurately, so everyone gets a better idea of when things will be done.</li></ul>",
            })

            +bullet({
              class: "bullet--margin-extra",
              bulletContent: "<ul class=\"styled-list styled-list--inside-sm\"><li class=\"styled-list__item\"><strong>Small phases are less risky.</strong> Bugs may occur, but by keeping each deployed change small you risk deploying fewer bugs at a time, and make any that do creep in easier to identify and squash.</li></ul>",
            })

            p So, next time you‘re struggling to get things done, try breaking your project up into small phases, and see how much easier it is to release features, keep stakeholders happy, and build trust.

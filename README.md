# Leaf

This is Leaf's static site build. It uses [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) for the templating, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for client side dependencies, [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling and [Laravel Mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix) / [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) for the build.

## Install

Run `npm install`

## Usage

- Run `npm run dev` to build the site
- Run `npm run watch` to build the site and watch for changes
- Run `npm run prod` to build a production ready version of the site

## Deployments

Pushing to the `master` branch will deploy to [Netlify](https://weareleaf.netlify.com)

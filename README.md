### Automated building
Source code written in the `./code/` directory is converted and moved over to `./dist/` as part this template's build process. The following conversions are automated:

 - **Automatic compilation of Pug/Jade:** Any `.pug` or `.jade` files in `./code/` and its subdirectories will be converted.
 - **Automatic compilation of Sass:** Any `.scss` files in `./code/` and its subdirectories will be converted.
 - **Automatic compilation of JavaScript:** A JS module starting from `./code/scripts/index.js` will be webpacked and minified into a single bundle.
 - **Automatic optimisation of images:** Any `.jpg` files in `./code/` and its subdirectories will be optimised.

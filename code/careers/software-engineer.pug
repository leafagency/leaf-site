      h3 About Leaf

      p We are Leaf; we transform businesses with bespoke digital products and services that let them serve their customers better, faster and at global scale. We're very young, but have already worked with some pretty cool brands, including the likes of <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/">Zendesk</a>, <a href="https://www.holidayextras.co.uk/">Holiday Extras</a> and <a href="https://riftrefunds.co.uk">RIFT</a>. Having smashed our first two years, we're now looking to grow our team.

      h3 About the role

      p We're looking for a highly intelligent and driven Software Engineer with solid leadership and communication skills. Your role will be split between hands-on engineering and project leadership:

      ul
        li Product engineering: You will work on all parts of the stack, from configuring web services and writing APIs, to setting up continuous integration and building buttery smooth front-ends with React.
        li Project leadership: You'll be managing the development of software projects, leading other engineers and communicating directly clients to deliver quality work.

      p Written communication skills, a drive to self-teach and the instinct to take an independent lead on projects are critically important in this role. You will be supported gladly, but will not always be hand-held through your day.

      p We want you to be excited about being a key part of growing a small business into a recognised and respected brand, and growing yourself into one of the most senior members of our the business. If that doesn't excite you, then this job isn't for you.

      h3 We're looking for
      ul
        li Proof that you can program: This could be anything from a side project to a web application you've worked on previously. We expect your skills to be strong enough to be able to get work done without constant supervision, and to be able to make pragmatic architectural choices along the way. Experience with either Ruby or JavaScript is a bonus here.
        li Ability to lead: We won't ask you to be anyone's manager, but we will expect you to lead projects, orchestrating development work.
        li A natural communicator: Being able to articulate your point to technical and non-technical people alike is everything.
        li A product mindset: You'll need an appreciation for your users, and a sense of duty around building great products.

      h3 Location

      p Although we're technically based in the UK, we all work remotely. As such, we're open to anyone able to work with a good amount of crossover with a European time zone.

      h3 How to apply

      p If reading about this position gave you butterflies, we want to hear from you. Tell us a bit about yourself and why you'd be a good fit, along with a CV and some examples of your work.

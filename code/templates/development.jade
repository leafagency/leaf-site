          h3 Technical consultancy
          p We understand that software development isnâ€™t always easy. Hard decisions have to be made without the benefit of hindsight and things can easily go wrong. We've been there and back again many times.

          p Use our technical consultancy as a way to clear the fog and truly understand where your developmental problems lie. We can review your code to identify areas of technical debt, advise on automation strategies to get machines doing your hard work for you, or build you a technical roadmap to get your team's focus back on track.

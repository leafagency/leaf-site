            h2 New products
            p Having worked on several new products with startups and as part of larger organisations, we're very well versed on how to do product development properly.

            p We'll guide you getting to your Minimum Viable Product, working in an Agile manner and iterating towards a good product/market fit without burning cash on unproven demand.

          h2 Technical consultancy
          p We understand that software development isnâ€™t always easy. Hard decisions have to be made without the benefit of hindsight and things can easily go wrong. We've been there and back again many times.

          p Use our technical consultancy as a way to clear the fog and truly understand where your developmental problems lie. We can review your code to identify areas of technical debt, advise on automation strategies to get machines doing your hard work for you, or build you a technical roadmap to get your team's focus back on track.

          h2 Coaching
          p A lack of technical skills can hold back your development velocity, and worse still saddle you with months of technical debt to clean up at a later date. When you need to get things moving quickly, there's sometimes not the free time available for your time to learn entirely on the job.

          p We come from technical leadership positions in larger organisations. We're patient knowledge sharers and  experienced in sharing our skills effectively with others. Use us to quickly level-up your team members with one-on-one coaching or small workshops. Get it right the first time.

          h3 The brief

          p CakeBoxx Technologies offer a range of revolutionary shipping containers, and wanted to modernise their digital presence. On-site analytics had shown a sharp increase in handheld devices being used to view the site, and CakeBoxx were keen to capitalise on this by optimising the site for smaller screens. In November 2015, they approached Leaf looking to refresh their existing site.

          h3 The challenge

          p It quickly became clear that the biggest challenge would be condensing and re-focussing content. The site was full of well written copy, but there was far too much of it. The sheer volume pointed to a lack of prioritisation, which in turn diluted the messages being conveyed.

          h3 Our approach

          p We started by creating a set of guidelines to facilitate the creation of any new content. While the pages were content-heavy, the site structure too was unnecessarily complicated, and simplifying the underlying information architecture provided a solid, focussed base to build on.
          p With a short turnaround time in mind, the decision was made to customise an existing theme. We made the decision to use WordPress as the content management system of choice, opening the door to a huge selection of professional themes available.
